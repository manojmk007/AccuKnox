Yes, Django signals run in the same thread as the caller by default. The thread name printed inside the signal handler will match the thread name of the main thread, confirming that they are executed in the same thread.
Here is the example:

from django.db.models.signals import post_save
from django.dispatch import receiver
from django.contrib.auth.models import User
import threading
@receiver(post_save, sender=User)
def my_signal_handler(sender, instance, **kwargs):
    print(f"Signal Thread: {threading.current_thread().name}")
import threading
from django.contrib.auth.models import User
print(f"Main Thread: {threading.current_thread().name}")
user = User.objects.create(username="test_user")
