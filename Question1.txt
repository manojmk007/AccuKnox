By default, Django signals are executed synchronously.
Here is the exapmle:

from django.db.models.signals import post_save
from django.dispatch import receiver
from django.contrib.auth.models import User
import time
@receiver(post_save, sender=User)
def my_signal_handler(sender, instance, **kwargs):
    print("Signal started...")
    time.sleep(5)  # Simulate a time-consuming operation
    print("Signal finished.")
import time
from django.contrib.auth.models import User
start_time = time.time()
user = User.objects.create(username="test_user")
end_time = time.time()
print(f"Time taken: {end_time - start_time} seconds")
